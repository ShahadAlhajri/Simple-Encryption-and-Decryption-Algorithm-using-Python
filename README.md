# Simple-Encryption-and-Decryption-Algorithm-using-Python
This algorithm is a bit-oriented scheme designed to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a binary key. It leverages one's complement, two's complement, and XOR operations to provide robust encryption. Implemented in Python, it is accessible and easy to integrate.
